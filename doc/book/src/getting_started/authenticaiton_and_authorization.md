# Authentication and Authorization (if applicable)

If the API requires an API key for authentication, you'll need to obtain one from the API provider. Once you have an API key, you can pass it to the client library when creating a client instance.

## JavaScript Example

```javascript
const apiKey = 'your-api-key';
```

## cURL Example

```shell
export API_KEY='your-api-key'
```

## Go Example

```go
apiKey := "your-api-key"
```

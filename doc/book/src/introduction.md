# Introduction

## Overview of the Client Library

The client library for our API is a Go package that simplifies the process of interacting with the API, providing a set of easy-to-use functions to perform common tasks such as creating, updating, and querying data. The library abstracts away the low-level details of HTTP requests and responses, allowing developers to focus on building their applications.

## Purpose and Benefits

The primary purpose of the client library is to make it more efficient and convenient for developers to interact with the API. By using the client library, developers can:

* Reduce the amount of boilerplate code needed to work with the API
* Handle errors and edge cases more easily
* Improve code readability and maintainability

In addition, the client library aims to provide a consistent and idiomatic interface that aligns with the best practices of the Go programming language, further enhancing the developer experience.

## API Version and Compatibility

The client library is compatible with version 1 of the API, as indicated by the /v1/ prefix in the API endpoints. As the API evolves, future versions of the client library will be released to maintain compatibility and provide access to new features.

It is recommended to always use the latest version of the client library to ensure compatibility with the latest features and improvements in the API. However, the library is designed to be backward compatible, so that existing code using older versions of the library should continue to work without modifications when updating the library version.

## Requirements and Dependencies

To use the client library, you must have the following:

* Go 1.15 or later
* An active API key for authentication (if applicable)

The client library has minimal dependencies, which are managed using Go modules. When you import the library into your project, the Go toolchain will automatically handle downloading and installing the required dependencies.

# Error handling best practices

By following these best practices, you can effectively handle errors when working with the API and ensure your application is resilient and informative when encountering issues.

* Handle specific error types: When handling errors, it's a good practice to handle specific error types explicitly. This allows for better error reporting and handling tailored to each error type.
* Use retries with exponential backoff: When encountering transient errors, such as network issues or server errors, implement retries with exponential backoff. This strategy helps reduce the load on the server and increases the chances of a successful request.
* Provide clear error messages: Ensure that error messages are clear and informative, allowing users to understand the cause of the error and how to resolve it.
* Log errors: Log errors, including request details and response data, to help with debugging and identifying potential issues in your application.
* Implement fallback mechanisms: In case of errors, implement fallback mechanisms to ensure your application can continue functioning or gracefully degrade its functionality.

Python example:

```python
import requests

try:
    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(data))
    response.raise_for_status()
    print("Data inserted")
except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as e:
    status_code = e.response.status_code
    message = e.response.json().get("message")

    if status_code == 400:
        print(f"Bad Request: {message}")
    elif status_code == 401:
        print(f"Unauthorized: {message}")
    elif status_code == 403:
        print(f"Forbidden: {message}")
    elif status_code == 404:
        print(f"Not Found: {message}")
    elif status_code == 500:
        print(f"Internal Server Error: {message}")
    else:
        print(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"Error sending request: {e}")
```

# InceptionDB

A home made database based on journal to store JSON documents.

## Motivation

InceptionDB was born to be the persistence layer of another project called Bitumen. Bitumen is a distributed NAS that should store family memories, pictures and videos that should last for 50 or 100 years.

One of the biggest motivations is the code should be simple and easy to maintain (yes, even the database itself) and also 100% free of license restrictions.

The second biggest motivation is to have fun and learn some things :D.

## Technical overview

InceptionDB stores all the data in memory and also a copy on disk in the form of a journal.
